# AI Referencing & Citation Game ü§ñüìö

An interactive game focused on helping students apply correct academic referencing for AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) alongside traditional sources. It now emphasises: including prompts, citing model versions, disclosing usage, and creating transparent appendices‚Äîaligned with emerging JCQ-style guidance on responsible AI use in assessments.

## üéÆ Game Overview

The Academic Referencing Game presents students with incomplete academic references that are "falling" down the screen. Players must quickly select the correct, properly formatted citation from three options before the reference reaches the bottom. The game covers multiple academic subjects and helps reinforce proper citation formatting skills.

## ‚ú® Features

- NEW AI Subject: Dedicated pool of AI citation examples (model outputs, prompts, technical reports, methodology notes)
- Appendix Prompt Mode: Falling editable chat transcript; choose best practice (e.g., avoid screenshots, include prompt, model version, date/time)
- In-text Citation Mode: Identify the correct Harvard-style in‚Äëtext citation
- Full Reference Mode: Select the fully correct formatted reference (books, articles, reports, AI outputs)
- Methodology / Disclosure Examples: Shows how to ethically declare AI assistance
- Score Tracking & Progressive Difficulty: Maintain streak awareness under time pressure
- Accessible & Responsive UI: Keyboard friendly, mobile adaptive
- Educational Hints: Subtle reinforcement (editable transcript vs ‚ÄúMake this uneditable (screenshot)‚Äù distractor)

## üéØ How to Play

1. Select a Subject from the dropdown
2. A question appears in one of two modes:
   - Reference mode: a partially blanked reference falls from the top
   - In-text mode: a full reference displays with a sample paragraph
3. Choose the correct option from the three choices at the bottom
4. Beat the Clock: in Reference mode, answer before it reaches the bottom (In-text mode has no fall)
5. Build Your Score: each correct answer increases your score
6. Restart: after Game Over, click the Restart button to play again

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## üéì Educational Value & JCQ-Style AI Referencing Principles

While you must always follow your institution‚Äôs specific guidance, emerging UK (e.g., JCQ-style) expectations for responsible student AI use commonly emphasise:

1. Transparency: Declare that an AI tool was used and HOW it was used.
2. Attribution: Cite AI outputs if they directly inform wording, structure, examples, or summarisation.
3. Prompt Accountability: Preserve the exact prompt(s) used (appendix) so academic judgement can verify originality and integrity.
4. Version & Date: Record model name/version and access/generation date & time (models change over time).
5. Verification: Fact‚Äëcheck and critically evaluate AI outputs (don‚Äôt accept hallucinations). Avoid representing AI-generated content as your own analysis.
6. No Hidden Screenshots: Provide searchable text transcripts; screenshots reduce accessibility and auditability.

### AI Referencing Patterns (Harvard-style examples)

In‚Äëtext citation (tool as corporate author): (OpenAI, 2025)
Narrative form: According to OpenAI (2025)‚Ä¶

Reference list (model interaction with prompt disclosure):
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Sep 2025 version) [Large language model]. Prompt: "Explain the ethical implications of AI in secondary education, focusing on assessment integrity." Generated 19 September 2025. Available at: https://chat.openai.com/ (Accessed: 19 September 2025).

Reference list (technical report):
OpenAI. (2023). GPT-4 Technical Report. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774 (Accessed: 19 September 2025).

Methodology / disclosure note (often placed in introduction or appendix, not necessarily reference list):
An AI tool (ChatGPT, Sep 2025 version, OpenAI) was used to brainstorm alternative phrasing for section 2. Outputs were fact‚Äëchecked, paraphrased, and cited where directly relied upon (see Appendix A for prompt transcript).

Appendix transcript best practice (selected as correct in-game): Provide a clearly labelled appendix with: prompt(s), model name & version, date/time, any system instructions, and a note of edits. Do NOT rely on an uneditable screenshot.

Quoted output example (if verbatim):
"Overfitting occurs when a model memorises training noise" (OpenAI, 2025).

Paraphrased example: Overfitting is when a model memorises patterns that do not generalise (OpenAI, 2025).

Tip: If multiple prompts were used, list them sequentially with timestamps.


This game helps students with:
- **Citation Format Recognition**: Practice identifying correct academic formatting
- **Subject-Specific References**: Learn conventions across different academic disciplines
- **Time Management**: Develop quick recognition skills under pressure
- **Reference Components**: Understand author, year, title, publisher, and location formatting
